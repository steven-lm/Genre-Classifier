## Overview
I enjoy reading books in my spare time so i decied to create this project to automate the process of reading book blurbs to classify it's genres. Multi label classification is also a prominent area of research in Machine Learning so I was intrigued with the challenge of combining text analysis and multi label prediction. 

**Approach:** 
To build a model which accurately predicts multiple book genres, we will be training three different models and comparing them. 
 - Random Forest Classifier
 - Logistic Regression Classifier (Incorportated with OneVsAll)
 - Deep Feedfoward Neural Network

## Dataset:
**Name:** CMU Book Summary Dataset
**Books:** 16,559
**Metadata:**

 - Wiki ID
 - Freebase ID
 - Book Title
 - Book Author
 - Publication Date
 - Genres
