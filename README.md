## Overview
This project was made as part of the Microsoft Student Accelerator program 2020.

I enjoy reading books in my spare time so i decided to create this project to automate the process of reading book blurbs to classify its genres. Multi label classification is also a prominent area of research in Machine Learning so I was intrigued with the challenge of combining text analysis and multi label prediction. 

**Approach:** 
To build a model that accurately predicts multiple book genres, we will be training three different models and comparing them. 
 - Random Forest Classifier
 - Logistic Regression Classifier (Incorporated with OneVsAll)
 - Deep Feedfoward Neural Network
